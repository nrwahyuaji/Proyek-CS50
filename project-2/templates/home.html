        <p>The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is the opportunity to take a newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop very own piece of software. So long as the project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to the participants, albeit subject to the staff’s approval. The participants may implement their project in any language(s) as long as the staff approves. They are welcome to utilize any infrastructure, provided the staff ultimately has access to any hardware and software that their project requires. All that we ask is that they build something of interest to them, that they solve an actual problem, that they impact campus, or that they change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.</p>
