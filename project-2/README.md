<p><strong><h1>CS50 Final Project - Homework Framework</p></strong></h1>

<p>The following project that our group made is a webpage that the teachers are able to give assignment to students then the students are able to open the link then submit their assignment. We made this to expand our knowledge of HTML, CSS, Flask, Jinja, etc.</p>
<p>The technologies that we used are as follow:
  <ol type='a'>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Flask</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Jinja</li>
    <li>and other small things</li>
    
<p><strong><h2>How the webpage works?</p></strong></h2>
    
<p>Our idea is simple. When the students are given our website then login first or to our visitor we provide username and password for demo. They will click enter or     sign in. After that they fill in:
<ul>
  <li>username</li>
  <li>password</li>
</ul>
 then log in. we provide the demo username and password. 
    
<p>For teachers, we have routing, get and post method, render_template, redirect and some instruction in app.py.
